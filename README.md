Dotfiles
========

CIS191--Project3--Keeping track of dotfiles
1. .bashrc, aliases from HW3 on lines 106-109. I created a soft link between
this .bashrc and ~/.bashrc so I can edit within this project, push to git, and
have the changes enacted on my computer.
2. .vimrc--I similarly created a soft link between ~/.vimrc and ./.vimrc
