Dotfiles
========

CIS191--Project3--Keeping track of dotfiles
1. .bashrc, aliases from HW3 on lines 106-109. I created a soft link between
this .bashrc and ~/.bashrc so I can edit within this project, push to git, and
have the changes enacted on my computer.
2. .vimrc--I similarly created a soft link between ~/.vimrc and ./.vimrc
3. .ssh files--I have put in my id_rsa.pub public key (for my Ubuntu machine)
and my authorized_keys from my eniac account.  They are the same.  I did not
make a config file because I like the default configurations.

This is the end of Project 3, Part I.
